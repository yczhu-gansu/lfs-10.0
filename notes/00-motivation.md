# Motivation

## Foreward
Prior to discovering Linux, we simply put up with issues in other Operating
Systems as you had no choice. It was what it was, whether you liked it or not.

With Linux, the concept of choice began to emerge. If you didn't like something,
you were free, even encouraged, to change it.

Create my own Linux system. Compile everything from source code.

After sorting thourgh issues such as circular dependencies and compile-time
errors, I finally built a custom-built Linux system.

It quickly became plain that such custom-built Linux systems serve not only to
meet user specific requirements, but also serve as an ideal learning opportunity
for programmers and system administrators to ehance their (existing) Linux
skills.

This Linux From Scratch book is the central core around that project. It
provides the background and instructions necessary for you to design and build
your own system.

## Audience
One important reason for this project's existence is to help you learn how a
Linux system works from the inside out. Building an LFS system helps
demonstrates what makes Linux tick, and how things work together and depend on
each other. One of the best things that this learning experience can provide is
the ability to customize a Linux system to suit your own unique needs.

The goal of Linux From Scratch is to build a complete and usable
foundation-level system.
