# Section 5.1 Introduction
This chapter 5 shows how to build a cross-compiler and its associated tools.

Although here cross-compilation is faked, the principles are the same as for a
real cross-toolchain.

The programs compiled in this chapter will be installed under the *$LFS/tools*
directory to keep them separate from the files installed in the follow chapters.

The libraries are installed into their final place, since they pertain to the
system we want to build.
