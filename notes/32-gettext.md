# Section 7.8 Gettext

The Gettext package contains utilities for internationalization and
localization. These allow programs to be compiled with NLS (Native Language
Support), enabling them to output messages in the user's native language.

## Configure Arguments
```bash
--disable-shared
```
We do not need to install any of the shared Gettext libraries at this time,
there for there is no need to build them.
